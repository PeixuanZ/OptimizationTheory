# Introduction to Optimization

Optimization is the process of finding the best solution to a problem. In this lecture, we cover the basics of optimization theory.

## Key Concepts

- **Objective Function**: The function to be optimized.
- **Constraints**: The limitations or conditions that the solution must satisfy.
- **Feasible Region**: The set of all possible solutions that satisfy the constraints.

## Example

Consider the following optimization problem:

$$ \min_{x} \ f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 $$

Subject to:

$$ x \geq 0 $$

The optimal solution can be found by solving the first-order condition:

$$ \frac{d}{dx} f(x) = 0 $$
